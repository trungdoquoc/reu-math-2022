## About the research:  
**Research Title**: Solving the Schrodinger eigenvalue problem using deep learning

**Author**: Trung Do, under supervision of professor YuLong Lu

*Department of Mathematics, University of Massachusetts Amherst*

**Summary**: We study the effectiveness of using feedforward neural network to solve or- dinary differential equation, particularly the one-dimensional Schr Ìˆodinger equation. We compare the accuracy of the neural network solutions with the solutions from another analytical method, the Finite Difference method. Based on the empirical result, we found the optimal network architecture that results in solutions with high accuracy compare to solu- tions of the analytical method. We conclude the study with some future research ideas.
